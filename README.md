# React Trello Clone
A replica of a Trello task board, featuring draggable tasks within columns. 

## Functions

2. Entering text and clicking the "Add Card" button will create a new card within that column, and clicking the "X" will cancel the action
3. The text validation message will pop up if there's no text value when clicking the "Add Card" button

## Technical Details
1. Implement using pure CSS
